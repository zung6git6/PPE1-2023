Human- versus Artificial Intelligence

--

   AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little
   common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of
   human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many
   relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics
--
   conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence
   as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide
   more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives,
   this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences
   between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental
   constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human
--
   3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of
   narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have
   fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than
--
   possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe
   to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we
   capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial
   intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and
   compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice
   versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI “partners” with human
   (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human
   limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI
   systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an
   adequate mental model of the underlying ‘psychological’ mechanisms of
   AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems,
   Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.
--

   Recent advances in information technology and in AI may allow for more
   coordination and integration between of humans and technology.
   Therefore, quite some attention has been devoted to the development of
   Human-Aware AI, which aims at AI that adapts as a “team member” to the
   cognitive possibilities and limitations of the human team members. Also

   must be able to sense, understand, and react to a wide range of complex

   these “AI partners,” or “team mates” have to be endowed with human-like
   (or humanoid) cognitive abilities enabling mutual understanding and

   However, no matter how intelligent and autonomous AI agents become in
   certain respects, at least for the foreseeable future, they probably

   mind, it becomes more and more important that human professionals
   working with advanced AI systems, (e.g. in military‐ or policy making
   teams) develop a proper mental model about the different cognitive
   capacities of AI systems in relation to human cognition. This issue
   will become increasingly relevant when AI systems become more advanced
   and are deployed with higher degrees of autonomy. Therefore, the
--
   development of education and training programs for humans who have to
   use or “collaborate with” advanced AI systems in the near and far
   future.

   With the application of AI systems with increasing autonomy more and
   more researchers consider the necessity of vigorously addressing the

   Tanner, 2012). Because of the many differences between the underlying
   substrate and architecture of biological and artificial intelligence
   this anthropocentric way of reasoning is probably unwarranted. For
--
   “intelligence” as: “the capacity to realize complex goals” (Tegmark,
   2017). These goals may pertain to narrow, restricted tasks (narrow AI)
   or to broad task domains (AGI). Building on this definition, and on a
--
   automatically and efficiently over a broad range of tasks and contexts.
   Relevant AGI research differs from the ordinary AI research by
   addressing the versatility and wholeness of intelligence, and by

   would be very useful, for example when a high degree of social
   intelligence of AI will contribute to more adequate interactions with
   humans, for example in health care or for entertainment purposes

   intelligence in relation to the most probable potentials (and real
   upcoming issues) of AI in the short- and mid-term future. This will
   provide food for thought in anticipation of a future that is difficult
   to predict for a field as dynamic as AI.

   is the “real” form of intelligence. This is even already implicitly
   articulated in the term “Artificial Intelligence”, as if it were not
   entirely real, i.e., real like non-artificial (biological)

   next insult for humanity” (van Belkom, 2019). This goes as far that the
   rapid progress in the field of artificial intelligence is accompanied
   by a recurring redefinition of what should be considered “real

   that only humans can do.” In line with this, AI is then defined as “the
   study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment,

   of real intelligence, (e.g. Bergstein, 2017). For instance, Facebook’s
   director of AI and a spokesman in the field, Yann LeCun, mentioned at a
   Conference at MIT on the Future of Work that machines are still far
--
   To make this point clear, we first will provide some insight into the
   basic nature of both human and artificial intelligence. This is
   necessary for the substantiation of an adequate awareness of

   • AGI is often not necessary; many complex problems can also be tackled
   effectively using multiple narrow AI’s.^1

   prevailing notion in this respect among AI scientists is that
   intelligence is ultimately a matter of information and computation, and

Fundamental Differences Between Biological and Artificial Intelligence

--
   instance, Ackermann. (2018) writes: “Before reaching superintelligence,
   general AI means that a machine will have the same cognitive
   capabilities as a human being”. So, researchers deliberate extensively
   about the point in time when we will reach general AI, (e.g., Goertzel,
   2007; Müller and Bostrom, 2016). We suppose that these kinds of
--
   human-like intelligence is just one of those. This means, for example
   that the development of AI is determined by the constraint of physics
   and technology, and not by those of biological evolution. So, just as
--
   intelligence. Below we briefly summarize a few fundamental differences
   between human and artificial intelligence (Bostrom, 2014):

--
   learned a new skill, this will be bounded to the system itself. In
   contrast, if an AI system has learned a certain skill then the
   constituting algorithms can be directly copied to all other similar
--

   ‐Speed: Signals from AI systems propagate with almost the speed of
   light. In humans, the conduction velocity of nerves proceeds with a
--
   limited bandwidth. This is slower and more difficult than the
   communication of AI systems that can be connected directly to each
   other. Thanks to this direct connection, they can also collaborate on
--

   ‐Updatability and scalability: AI systems have almost no constraints
   with regard to keep them up to date or to upscale and/or re-configure
--
   lead to different qualities and limitations between human and
   artificial intelligence. Our response speed to simple stimuli is, for
   example, many thousands of times slower than that of artificial
--
   other and as such can be part of one integrated system. This means that
   AI systems do not have to be seen as individual entities that can
   easily work alongside each other or have mutual misunderstandings. And
   if two AI systems are engaged in a task then they run a minimal risk to
   make a mistake because of miscommunications (think of autonomous
--
   Because of these differences it may be very misleading to use our own
   mind as a basis, model or analogy for reasoning about AI. This may lead
   to erroneous conceptions, for example about the presumed abilities of
   humans and AI to perform complex tasks. Resulting flaws concerning
   information processing capacities emerge often in the psychological
--
   be acceptable in psychological research, this may be misleading if we
   strive for understanding the intelligence of AI systems. For us it is
   much more difficult to multiply two random numbers of six digits than

   So, if there would exist AI systems with general intelligence that can
   be used for a wide range of complex problems and objectives, those AGI
--
   profile, including other cognitive qualities, than humans have
   (Goertzel, 2007). This will be even so, if we manage to construct AI
   agents who display similar behavior like us and if they are enabled to
   adapt to our way of thinking and problem-solving in order to promote
   human-AI teaming. Unless we decide to deliberately degrade the
   capabilities of AI systems (which would not be very smart), the
   underlying capacities and abilities of man and machines with regard to
--
   Because of these differences we should focus at systems that
   effectively complement us, and that make the human-AI system stronger
   and more effective. Instead of pursuing human-level AI it would be more
   beneficial to focus on autonomous machines and (support) systems that
--
   terms of goals, virtues, rules and norms expressed in (fuzzy) language,
   AI has already established excellent capacities to process and
   calculate directly on highly complex data. Therefore, or the execution
--
   computational), modern digital intelligence may be more effective and
   efficient than biological intelligence. AI may thus help to produce
   better answers for complex problems using high amounts of data,
--
   logic reasoning, (e.g. Korteling et al., 2018b). Therefore, we
   conjecture that ultimately the development of AI systems for supporting
   human decision making may appear the most effective way leading to the
--
   complex issues. So, the cooperation and division of tasks between
   people and AI systems will have to be primarily determinated by their
   mutually specific qualities. For example, tasks or task components that
   appeal to capacities in which AI systems excel, will have to be less
   (or less fully) mastered by people, so that less training will probably
   be required. AI systems are already much better than people at
   logically and arithmetically correct gathering (selecting) and
--
   without any “self-interest” or “own hidden agenda.” Based on these
   qualities AI systems may effectively take over tasks, or task
   components, from people. However, it remains important that people
--

   In general, people are better suited than AI systems for a much broader
   spectrum of cognitive and social tasks under a wide variety of
--
   are also better at the social-psychosocial interaction for the time
   being. For example, it is difficult for AI systems to interpret human
   language and -symbolism. This requires a very extensive frame of
   reference, which, at least until now and for the near future, is
   difficult to achieve within AI. As a result of all these differences,
   people are still better at responding (as a flexible team) to
--
   division of tasks, capitalizing on the specific qualities and
   limitations of humans and AI systems, human decisional biases may be
   circumvented and better performance may be expected. This means that
--
   constraints and biases, may have more surplus value than striving at
   collaboration between humans and AI that have developed the same
   (human) biases. Although cooperation in teams with AI systems may need
   extra training in order to effectively deal with this bias-mismatch,

   other fields of complex technology, (e.g. Modeling &amp; Simulation), AI
   systems need to be verified (meeting specifications) and validated

   intransparant (Nosek et al., 2011; Feldman-Barret, 2017). Therefore,
   trust in AI should be primarily based on its objective performance.
   This forms a more important base than providing trust on the basis of

The Impact of Multiple Narrow AI Technology

--
   AGI, like human general intelligence, would have many obvious
   advantages, compared to narrow (limited, weak, specialized) AI. An AGI
   system would be much more flexible and adaptive. On the basis of

   to view them from different perspectives (as people—ideally—also can
   do). A characteristic of the current (narrow) AI tools is that they are
   skilled in a very specific task, where they can often perform at
   superhuman levels, (e.g. Goertzel, 2007; Silver et al., 2017). These
   specific tasks have been well-defined and structured. Narrow AI systems
   are less suitable, or totally unsuitable, for tasks or task
--
   circumstances. In the context of (unforeseen) changes in goals or
   circumstances, the adequacy of current AI is considerably reduced
   because it cannot reason from a general perspective and adapt
   accordingly (Lake et al., 2017; Horowitz, 2018). As with narrow AI
   systems, people are then needed to supervise on these deviations in
--

Multiple Narrow AI is Most Relevant Now!

   The potential high prospects of AGI, however, do not imply that AGI
   will be the most crucial factor in future AI R&amp;D, at least for the
   short- and mid-term. When reflecting on the great potential benefits of
   general intelligence, we tend to consider narrow AI applications as
   separate entities that can very well be outperformed by a broader AGI
--
   technological innovations, at the system level the total and wide range
   of emerging AI applications will also have a groundbreaking
   technological and societal impact (Peeters et al., 2020). This will be
--
   So, it will be much more profitable and beneficial to develop and build
   (non-human-like) AI variants that will excel in areas where people are
   inherently limited. It seems not too far-fetched to suppose that the
   multiple variants of narrow AI applications also gradually get more
   broadly interconnected. In this way, a development toward an ever
   broader realm of integrated AI applications may be expected. In
   addition, it is already possible to train a language model AI
   (Generative Pre-trained Transformer3, GPT-3) with a gigantic dataset

   Besides, the moravec Paradox implies that the development of AI
   “partners” with many kinds of human (-level) qualities will be very

   boundaries of human capabilities) will be relatively low. The most
   fruitful AI applications will mainly involve supplementing human
   constraints and limitations. Given the present incentives for
   competitive technological progress, multiple forms of (connected)
   narrow AI systems will be the major driver of AI impact on our society
   for short- and mid-term. For the near future, this may imply that AI
   applications will remain very different from, and in many aspects
--
   Intelligence is a multi-dimensional (quantitative, qualitative)
   concept. All dimensions of AI unfold and grow along their own different
   path with their own dynamics. Therefore, over time an increasing number
   of specific (narrow) AI capacities may gradually match, overtake and
   transcend human cognitive capacities. Given the enormous advantages of
   AI, for example in the field of data availability and data processing
   capacities, the realization of AGI probably would at the same time

   So when AI will truly understand us as a “friend,” “partner,” “alter
   ego” or “buddy,” as we do when we collaborate with other humans as

   being. According to most AI scientists, this will certainly happen, and
   the key question is not IF this will happen, but WHEN, (e.g., Müller
   and Bostrom, 2016). At a system level, however, multiple narrow AI
   applications are likely to overtake human intelligence in an

   human and artificial intelligences. First we presented ideas and
   arguments to scale up and differentiate our conception of intelligence,

   better aware of the most probable potentials of AI applications for the
   short- and medium-term future. For example, from this perspective, our

   differences between natural and artificial intelligences, human-like
   AGI will be very difficult to accomplish in the first place (and also

   scope of human perceptual-motor and cognitive abilities. Instead, the
   most profitable AI applications for the short- and mid-term future,
   will probably be based on multiple narrow AI systems. These multiple
   narrow AI applications may catch up with human intelligence in an
   increasingly broader range of areas.
--
   From this point of view we advocate not to dwell too intensively on the
   AGI question, whether or when AI will outsmart us, take our jobs, or
   how to endow it with all kinds of human abilities. Given the present
   state of the art it may be wise to focus more on the whole system of
   multiple AI innovations with humans as a crucial connecting and
   supervising factor. This also implies the establishment and
   formalization of legal boundaries and proper (effective, ethical, safe)
   goals for AI systems (Elands et al., 2019; Aliman, 2020). So this human
   factor (legislator, user, “collaborator”) needs to have good insight

   concern how to use it intelligently? For what tasks and under what
   conditions decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment
   required? How can we capitalize on the strengths of human intelligence
   and how to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate
   for the inherent constraints of human cognition. See (Hoffman and

   information processing and intelligence differs from that of–the many
   possible and specific variants of—AI systems. Only when humans develop
   a proper of these “interspecies” differences they can effectively
   capitalize on the potential benefits of AI in (future) human-AI teams.
   Given the high flexibility, versatility, and adaptability of humans
   relative to AI systems, the first challenge becomes then how to ensure
   human adaptation to the more rigid abilities of AI?^4 In other words:
   how can we achieve a proper conception the differences between human-

   the simple notion that AIs excite as much about their performance in

   It needs to include at least a module on the cognitive characteristics
   of AI. This is basically a subject similar to those subjects that are
   also included in curricula on human cognition. This broad module on the
   “Cognitive Science of AI” may involve a range of sub-topics starting
   with a revision of the concept of "Intelligence" stripped of

   this module should focus at providing knowledge about the structure and
   operation of the AI operating system or the “AI mind.” This may be
   followed by subjects like: Perception and interpretation of information
   by AI, AI cognition (memory, information processing, problem solving,
   biases), dealing with AI possibilities and limitations in the “human”
   areas like creativity, adaptivity, autonomy, reflection, and (self-)
   awareness, dealing with goal functions (valuation of actions in
   relation to cost-benefit), AI ethics and AI security. In addition, such
   a curriculum should include technical modules providing insight into
   the working of the AI operating system. Due to the enormous speed with
   which the AI technology and application develops, the content of such a
   curriculum is also very dynamic and continuously evolving on the basis
--
   Below, we provide a global framework for the development of new
   educational curricula on AI awareness. These subtopics go beyond
   learning to effectively “operate,” “control” or interact with specific
   AI applications (i.e. conventional human-machine interaction):

   ‐Understanding of underlying system characteristics of the AI (the “AI
   brain”). Understanding the specific qualities and limitations of AI
   relative to human intelligence.
--
   ‐Understanding the complexity of the tasks and of the environment from
   the perspective of AI systems.

   ‐Understanding the problem of biases in human cognition, relative to
   biases in AI.

   ‐Understanding the problems associated with the control of AI,
   predictability of AI behavior (decisions), building trust, maintaining
   situation awareness (complacency), dynamic task allocation, (e.g.

   ‐Trust in the performance of AI (possibly in spite of limited

   man-machine system and being able to decide on when, for what, and how
   the integrated combination of human- and AI faculties may perform at
   best overall system potential.

   In conclusion: due to the enormous speed with which the AI technology
   and application evolves we need a more versatile conceptualization of
--
   challenges of machine intelligence, for instance to decide when to use
   or deploy AI in relation to tasks and their context. The development of
   educational curricula with new, targeted, and easily configurable
   training forms and learning environments for human-AI systems are
   therefore recommended. Further work should focus on training tools,
   methods and content that are flexible and adaptive enough to be able to
   keep up with the rapid changes in the field of AI and with the wide
   variety of target groups and learning goals.

Social choice ethics in artificial intelligence

   A major approach to the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is to
   use social choice, in which the AI is designed to act according to the
   aggregate views of society. This is found in the AI ethics of “coherent
   extrapolated volition” and “bottom–up ethics”. This paper shows that
   the normative basis of AI social choice ethics is weak due to the fact
   that there is no one single aggregate ethical view of society. Instead,
   the design of social choice AI faces three sets of decisions: standing,
   concerning whose ethics views are included; measurement, concerning how
   their views are identified; and aggregation, concerning how individual
   views are combined to a single view that will guide AI behavior. These
   decisions must be made up front in the initial AI design—designers
   cannot “let the AI figure it out”. Each set of decisions poses
   difficult ethical dilemmas with major consequences for AI behavior,
   with some decision options yielding pathological or even catastrophic
   results. Furthermore, non-social choice ethics face similar issues,
   such as whether to count future generations or the AI itself. These
   issues can be more important than the question of whether or not to use

Is social intelligence the future of AI?

As Artificial Intelligence plays an important role in our everyday lives,
implementing social awareness is the next step toward the future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), according to researchers.

--
   independently prioritise the appointments. A team of researchers has
   argued that the future of AI calls for the implementation of social
   intelligence to ensure that the growth of the technology is not stunted
--
   The work, ‘Artificial Social Intelligence: A Comparative and Holistic
   View,’ is published in CAAI Artificial Intelligence Research.

Artificial Social Intelligence is the future of AI

   “Artificial Intelligence has changed our society and our daily life,”
   said first author Lifeng Fan, National Key Laboratory of General
   Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Institute for General Artificial
   Intelligence (BIGAI). “What is the next important challenge for AI in
   the future? We argue that Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI) is the
   future of AI.”

--
   is important to use cognitive science and computational modelling to
   identify the gap between AI systems and human social intelligence, as
   well as current issues and future problems, for future advancements in
   AI.

AI models should incorporate social cues

--
   Fan argues that ASI requires a comprehensive approach, as unlike
   contemporary AI systems, improving specific components of an ASI system
   may not always result in improved performance. Instead, the future of
   AI needs technology that has the ability to interpret social cues, such
   as eye-rolling or yawning, to understand the mental state of other
--
   as well as consideration for how to introduce better human-like biases
   into ASI models to accelerate the future of AI.

--
   set up new evaluation protocols, and build new computational models.
   The ultimate goal is to equip AI with high-level ASI and lift human
   well-being with the help of Artificial Social Intelligence.”

   BERLIN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - France, Germany and Italy have reached an
   agreement on how artificial intelligence should be regulated, according
   to a joint paper seen by Reuters, which is expected to accelerate
--
   The three governments support "mandatory self-regulation through codes
   of conduct" for so-called foundation models of AI, which are designed
   to produce a broad range of outputs. But they oppose "un-tested norms."

   "Together we underline that the AI Act regulates the application of AI
   and not the technology as such," the joint paper said. "The inherent
   risks lie in the application of AI systems rather than in the
   technology itself."
--

   "An AI governance body could help to develop guidelines and could check
   the application of model cards," the joint paper said.
--
   with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, said laws and state control
   should not regulate AI itself, but rather its application.

--
   pleased an agreement had been reached with France and Germany to limit
   only the use of AI.

   "We need to regulate the applications and not the technology if we want
   to play in the top AI league worldwide," Wissing said.

   As governments around the world seek to capture the economic benefits

XTX Markets launching $10 million 'Artificial Intelligence Mathematical
Olympiad Prize'
--
   LONDON, Nov. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- XTX Markets is launching the
   Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad Prize ('AI-MO Prize'), a
   new $10mn challenge fund designed to spur the creation of a
   publicly-shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the
   International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

   A grand prize of $5mn will be awarded to the first publicly-shared AI
   model to enter an AI-MO approved competition and perform at a standard
   equivalent to a gold medal in the IMO.
--
   There will also be a series of progress prizes, totalling up to $5mn,
   for publicly-shared AI models that achieve key milestones towards the
   grand prize.
--

   Building on these traditions, the AI-MO Prize will accelerate progress
   beyond large language models like ChatGPT and develop new AI models
   that can reason mathematically. As such, the AI-MO Prize could
   represent a new Turing Test.
--

   "Using hard mathematical problems as a benchmark to determine if AI can
   match the highest cognitive functions of human beings is a wonderful
--

   I am sure that many people will be following the AI-MO Prize with great
   excitement, to see when, in the future, AI will match the world's
   brightest young minds."
--

   "Despite recent advances, using AI to solve, or at least assist with
   solving, advanced mathematical problems remains an incredibly
--

   The AI-MO Prize promises to provide at least one such set of benchmarks
   which will help compare different AI problem solving strategies at a
   technical level, in a manner that will be accessible and appealing to
--

   The prizes will be designed by an AI-MO Advisory Committee (to be
   appointed), including mathematicians, AI and machine learning experts,
   and experienced Olympiad problem-setters.

   The first AI-MO approved competitions will open to participants in
   early 2024. There will be a presentation of progress at the 65th IMO
--
   Geoff Smith, Former President, International Mathematical Olympiad and
   AI-MO Prize Advisory Committee Member, commented:

   "The ability of modern AI systems to create a facsimile of a human when
   engaging in a written exchange is remarkable. However, this works best
--
   delighted to be involved in supporting this competition, as we seek to
   measure AI systems against the best young mathematical minds."

--

   "XTX Markets is excited to be launching the AI-MO Prize to spur the
   development of AI models capable of mathematical reasoning. We look
   forward to working with mathematicians, scientists and technologists to
   develop the prizes, and to seeing how AI models compare against
   exceptional high-school mathematicians."

   technical breakthroughs, the world has recently been paying close
   attention to the frontiers of AI research. But last month the White
   House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the US released a memo
   on the use of more mundane AI systems in government that is likely, in
   the near term at least, to be equally consequential.

   president’s programme. And last month, the OMB director, Shalanda
   Young, released a memo that could revolutionise the use of AI in
   government in the US.
--
   The proposed policy – it is still a draft, and could be watered down –
   would require each department to appoint a chief AI officer and have
   them provide a register of existing AI use cases. This alone is a
   significant win for transparency. But in addition, the officer must

   AI systems are to receive plain language explanations of how AI is
   being used, and the opportunity to contest AI decisions.

   Impressively, the memo even addresses the deeply unsexy but important
   question of government procurement of AI. So many societal problems

   That was why the AI-generated pictures were used and the author names
   cannot be found elsewhere on the internet.

   This incident at Sports Illustrated comes as concern grows in the media
   world that generative artificial intelligence could cheaply replace
   journalists and potentially spread misinformation. Various newsrooms
   have experimented with AI or released guidelines for employees and
   audiences to explain their approach towards it.

   Some newsrooms have made headlines, however, after publishing AI
   articles that included errors or falsehoods. Others gained attention
   for not marking stories as AI generated.

   AI also brings efficiency to the media and entertainment sector.
   AI-driven tools enhance 3D animation and character modeling, resulting
   in more realistic visuals. AI-powered music composition aids composers
   in creating original soundtracks. Moreover, AI automates tasks such as
   video editing, proofreading, and ad copy generation, leading to cost
   savings and increased productivity. AI and machine learning have
   revolutionized the capabilities of entertainment companies, enabling

   personalized strategies to engage consumers and boost revenue. The
   emergence of AI-generated avatars and virtual news anchors is expected
   to become commonplace, providing lifelike and captivating news

   area, and AI has emerged as a vital tool for detecting and filtering
   objectionable content. AI can effectively determine user demographics,
   such as age and gender, thereby ensuring the appropriate delivery of

   Data privacy is a major legal concern regarding the use of AI by
   companies. AI systems require large amounts of data to improve their
   algorithms, so organizations need to ensure that the data they collect

   information. It’s important to note that once data is inputted into an
   AI system, it may no longer be confidential and will be subject to the
   system’s terms of use. Therefore, companies should not allow personal,
   confidential, or privileged data to be inputted into an AI system by
   staff or other agents.
--
   Intellectual property is another legal issue for organizations using
   AI. AI systems can generate new works, so organizations must have the
   necessary rights and licenses to use and distribute these works. It’s
--
   Companies must also consider potential tort liability issues that may
   arise from using AI. If an AI system produces harmful results due to
   inaccuracies, negligence, or biases, the organization may be held
   responsible for any resulting damages. Organizations should ensure that
   their AI systems are reliable and accurate, and carefully vet any work
   product that may affect industry or professional standards for accuracy

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Jobs: Assessing the Impact on Wages and
Employment
--
   The European Central Bank (ECB) recently released research on the
   complex relationship between AI adoption and its potential impact on
   wages and employment. Contrary to fears about job displacement, the
   study suggests that, at least for now, AI is more likely to affect
   wages than jobs.
--

AI’s Rapid Rise: A Double-Edged Sword

--
   Contrary to popular fears, the ECB study, which analyzed a sample of 16
   European countries, reveals that the adoption of AI has, so far, led to
   a net creation of jobs.

   Sectors exposed to AI have witnessed an increase in employment share,
   with a notable impact on the younger demographic and highly skilled
   workers. The findings challenge the notion that AI is an outright job
   destroyer, at least in the short term.
--
   The study shows that low and medium-skill jobs have remained largely
   unaffected by the adoption of AI. In contrast, highly skilled positions
   have experienced a considerable boost in demand.

   While AI’s impact on job creation is noteworthy, the research also
   sheds light on wage dynamics.
--
   The study indicates “neutral to slightly negative impacts” on earnings
   due to AI adoption. This suggests that while jobs may be growing, the
   wages associated with these positions might face challenges or
--
   The paper cautions that these findings don’t serve as a complete
   exoneration of AI’s influence on the labor market.

   The research notes that AI-enabled technologies are continuously
   evolving and being integrated into various sectors. The full extent of

   In light of historical and technological shifts, the research draws

   the era of AI is still unfolding.

   With AI technologies continuously advancing and being adopted at an

Art direction vs artificial intelligence: A helpful tool or an added hassle?

   AI-powered text-to-image tools are presenting a moral quandary in terms
   of creative ethics. But is there a way to use such tools while

   In this third article of Shades of Intelligence, a new series
   investigating artificial intelligence and the creative industry, we
   look at how machine learning might reshape the research stage of a
--
   know. This article investigates the visual research stage of a project,
   from moodboarding to art direction. For further investigations into AI
   and the creative process, head here.

   As things stand presently with artificial intelligence, it’s fair to
   say that most creatives have taken a few cautious initial steps into
   using machine learning. As our survey results suggest, 83% of creatives
   have already used AI tools, but wariness increases when the possibility
   of using these tools to actually create imagery comes to the fore.
--
   the alias Infinite Vibes. Originally a sound designer, the artist was
   initially attracted to AI as it offered a playground “ripe for
   experimentation,” as he describes it. A little over two years ago, a
   friend recommended a very early iteration of a Google Colab AI notebook
   – where users can write code in a browser format – and Dom, being “a
   bit obsessive by nature,” was hooked. Since that fateful day in June
   2021, he can count on one hand the days he hasn’t opened an AI tool or
   programme. He’s also busier than ever. “I’ve been freelance for almost
--
   of colourists and cinematographers. Given his deep understanding of
   AI’s capabilities, he can also create work fully on his own, and in a
   style he has taken the time to develop – an approach that is mindful in
   respect to other artists when it comes to moodboarding, but remains
   open-minded to AI-generated possibilities. “Art has been my life, for
   my entire life. I have a lot of sympathy and compassion for traditional
--
   modern artists. I am very careful about that and put a lot into work
   that’s not AI.” In short, the work of Infinite Vibes is, he says,
   “augmented by AI, rather than being dreamt up by it.”

   A recent example is Infinite Vibes’ music video for Jessy Lanza, I Hate
   Myself, created entirely by Dom and 15 separate AI tools. A dreamscape
   of images of Jessy presented as a variety of artworks, I Hate Myself
--
   The initial visualisation of these ideas will be created by Dom,
   usually in Blender, but then fed into AI tools for expansion. In this
   case, that first step began with the idea of a model of Jessy. To make
--
   extend these to the 16:9 ratio needed for a music video, using
   Photoshop’s Generative Fill tool. To give the AI Jessy Lanza the
   ability to sing, Jessy sent Dom an acapella version of the song to be
   used in another AI tool called SadTalker, which Dom used to make
   Jessy’s mouth and face move in sync with the song.

   Warp Fusion, which specialises in taking in video files so Dom can
   augment his animations with AI generation. Stable Diffusion can also be
   run locally on your own computer and, as it’s open source, “there’s a

   “optical flow” to keep the finished product coherent. “The issue with
   AI animation is if you’re feeding frames through, it will see every
   frame as a new image, applying a new diffusion over the top. You then

   and references still lead the work. As you can see in his lengthy
   process, AI doesn’tautomate his creativity, a process which still needs
   clarification from those who commission him: “Clients still don’t know

   peers. Respondents from the field of illustration were the least likely
   to have used AI in their practice, and were also the discipline most
   worried about AI’s impact on employment: 71% of illustrators stated
   they were concerned about how AI will affect their jobs, in comparison
   to 37% of all other respondents. Such concern is of course justified,

   honesty and transparency should be a given in our industry (whether
   you’re using an AI tool or not). However, until potential regulations
   are in place, one way to gain a better grasp on AI’s impact on

   additional options from the AI.” Then, he’ll take matters back into his
   own hands, opening Illustrator and vectorising the result and editing

   image,” the illustrator explains. “The AI takes that information and
   returns a set of four images based on it, which sometimes align with my

   intelligence”, when it comes to artists’ work being used in wider data
   sets. Interestingly, Seba’s AI experiments are also continuously well
   received amongst his community online. Much of this respect seems to be
   the result of Seba outwardly demonstrating his process, posting the
   original, the failures and the final AI-collaborated piece together. “I
   believe that showing the visual progression of a work from conception
   to completion can inspire curiosity and value,” he says. “In addition,
   my approach to AI focuses on free exploration… This constant search for
   innovation and authenticity is what can help create a connection with

   much of his work will be in tandem with an art director’s brief, the
   illustrator states how integrating AI into this back and forth could be
   viewed “as a positive thing,” he says. “I think it opens a door to a
   closer collaboration between [illustrators and art directors].” For
   example, Seba recently collaborated with fellow AI-inquisitive artists
   to generate prompts separately “and, once we had the images we liked,
--
   approach could be applied with an art director who set out to work with
   AI. We could each bring our perspective to the table and, from there,
   we would begin to generate images that would gradually approach a final

   Outside implementing AI as part of the dialogue between art director
   and commissioned artist, there are of course agencies developing
--
   Wagner’s Ring, Base pitched the idea of leaving artwork generation in
   the hands of AI – a concept loved by the designers creating the work,
   and the opera house itself.
--
   Not only offering a conceptual nod to La Monnaie’s programming, using
   AI in such a large campaign seemingly offered Base the opportunity to
   create a boundary-pushing, experiential identity system. Not to mention

   team member recalls a distinctive level of excitement towards the use
   of AI, sentimentally likening it to the same feeling they had as
   students. “It was so fun,” says design director Aurore plainly. “We
--
   into still images” through animation, also working with Tokkin Heads,
   “an AI that generates characters and the facial features to apply a
   templated animation, or just record with your webcam to create an
--
   framing interpolation, which generates in-between frames for a
   type-to-image transition. The final AI tool the team employed was
   Upscayl, used to upscale every image generated to principal resolution.
--
   Although these steps appear simple when noted down, the actual process
   of working with AI in a design context wasn’t without its challenges.
   Firstly, the imagery generated by Dall-E tested the creative limits of
--
   culture of content. We understood that we were still needed, which is
   the whole question around AI.”

   Like Seba’s communication approach, since completing the La Monnaie
   project Base has been extremely open, and proud, of this use case of AI
   as art direction and design. As pointed out by Manon: “It’s our duty to
--

   Arguably this is due to the fact that AI was only implemented due to
   its relevance for the overall theme of the opera season at hand, rather
   than “an excuse not to work, or have AI as a buzzword,” says Bruce. “On
   this project I received a lot of questions about whether AI is going to
   replace our jobs. In our personal experience, I think in many ways it
   can. But that’s more of a choice than an actual fate you have to
   accept. There are a few agencies working towards owning AI as their
   unique selling point, but I’m not sure whether that’s the strongest way
--
   will take our jobs.” Interestingly, since completing the project Base
   hasn’t used AI tools to this extent again, because, with this
   experience in mind, the concept hasn’t called for it.

   Within the context of using AI tools creatively, the moodboarding,
   commissioning and art direction steps discussed here are arguably the
--
   we’ve been careful to collaborate with individuals whose use cases of
   AI mirror our own sentiment, particularly in how they treat data sets
   that include other artists’ work.

   Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt for copyright infringement on
   their outputs – a case later dismissed. There is also currently little

   “AI is doing the dirty work,” Liljedahl told CNN. “But AI is not
   perfect, so we see it as a first tool, and then the human will come in
   after and really check and make sure that things make sense and explore
   the things that AI suggested.”

   The technology can also be used for solutions. A 2019 Google DeepMind
   project trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind
   turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to
   increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. AI
   can also help predict when and where energy demand is going to be

AWS and NVIDIA Expand Collaboration to Deliver Generative AI Infrastructure

--
   to deliver advanced infrastructure, software and services for
   generative artificial intelligence (AI) innovations.

   The partnership aims to provide customers with the necessary
   technologies for training foundation models and building generative AI
   applications, the companies said in a Tuesday (Nov. 28) press release.
--
   Additionally, NVIDIA and AWS will collaborate to host NVIDIA DGX Cloud,
   an AI-training-as-a-service, on AWS, the release said. This will be the
   first DGX Cloud featuring GH200 NVL32, providing developers with the
   largest shared memory in a single instance. DGX Cloud on AWS will
   accelerate the training of cutting-edge generative AI and large
   language models.
--
   The collaboration also includes Project Ceiba, where NVIDIA and AWS are
   designing the world’s fastest GPU-powered AI supercomputer, per the
   release. This supercomputer will feature 16,384 NVIDIA GH200 Superchips
   and will be used by NVIDIA for its own research and development in
   generative AI.

   AWS will introduce three new Amazon EC2 instances powered by NVIDIA
   GPUs: P5e instances for large-scale generative AI and high-performance
   computing (HPC) workloads, and G6 and G6e instances for a wide range of
   applications including AI fine-tuning, inference, graphics and video

   The AI revolution is here and it’s changing the world faster than

   Whether that’s for better or worse depends on whom you ask. What’s

   Canada’s AI pioneering dates back to the 1970s, when researchers formed
   the world’s first national AI association.

   artificial intelligence community by facilitating the exchange of
   knowledge through various media and venues.”

   It held its first annual conference in 1976, three years before the
   American Association for Artificial Intelligence was founded.

--
   phone calls were expensive. When you look at the earlier proceedings,
   you will see a pool of talent that was leading the world in AI,” said
   Denilson Barbosa, current CAIAC president.
--

   Its archive is a treasure trove of AI history. Its magazine debut in
   1984 talks about the potential and the influence of AI: “It is
   predictable that, awakening to their new place in the sun, AIers be
   distracted by sycophants, charlatans, and barmecides. Does the AIer
   grow frustrated with misconceptions about AI? You bet we do.”

   When most people think of AI, robots from movies — who can think for
   themselves — come to mind. That’s known as deep learning AI, found in
   the software of autonomous cars, facial recognition, mass surveillance
   and yes, some robots. It’s the AI that has the potential to think for
   itself and that scares a lot of people.

   technology of machine learning AI, which most people don’t realize we
   already use every day. It curates social media feeds, translates

   Most Canadians can’t tell what’s human or AI. A study released in
   October by the Canadian Journalism Foundation found that half of us are
   not confident in distinguishing the difference between social media
   content generated by AI compared with content created by humans.

   This unknown is leading to a lot of fear and misinformation about what
   AI is and isn’t doing. But whether we’re ready, it’s poised to change
   nearly everything we do and Canada is already playing a leading role.

WHO outlines considerations for regulation of artificial intelligence for
health

   The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new publication

   systems available to those who need them, and fostering dialogue among

   progress in analytic techniques – whether machine learning, logic-based
   or statistical – AI tools could transform the health sector. WHO
   recognizes the potential of AI in enhancing health outcomes by
   strengthening clinical trials; improving medical diagnosis, treatment,
   self-care and person-centred care; and supplementing health care
   professionals’ knowledge, skills and competencies. For example, AI
   could be beneficial in settings with a lack of medical specialists,
--

   However, AI technologies – including large language models – are being
   rapidly deployed, sometimes without a full understanding of how they
   may perform, which could either benefit or harm end-users, including
   health-care professionals and patients. When using health data, AI
   systems could have access to sensitive personal information,

   “Artificial intelligence holds great promise for health, but also comes
   with serious challenges, including unethical data collection,

   AI systems are complex and depend not only on the code they are built
   with but also on the data they are trained on, which come from clinical
   settings and user interactions – for example. Better regulation can
   help manage the risks of AI amplifying biases in training data.

   For example, it can be difficult for AI models to accurately represent
   the diversity of populations, leading to biases, inaccuracies or even

Artificial Intelligence: opening doors to a more diverse, equitable, and

   The age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has arrived, and with it the

   Union taking the lead with the most comprehensive set of rules to be

   innovative development but also close the door to the possibilities
   that AI holds for workers and employers.

--

   At its core, AI is simply a tool that, when used ethically and
   effectively, has vast promise for creating opportunities for people and
   businesses alike. With the assistance of AI, workers can better develop
   skills throughout their career, while the currently untapped skills of

   Through the use of AI, the future of work is bright. However, to make
   that future a reality, fair regulation is needed to allow for
   innovation and experimentation. As the European Union (EU) finalises

   that AI holds for workers and employers.

   What is clear is that AI as a whole cannot be simply categorised. With
   the EU leaning toward classifying AI in employment services as
   high-risk, WEC members view such a position as unwarranted and
   detrimental to the industry. It is clear that AI use within and across
   industries differs a great deal. From chatbots, ranking, to training
--

   Furthermore, with the scope of AI being incredibly broad, the HR
   industry is focused on taking a responsible and narrow approach to its
   use. Specifically, the industry welcomes polices that require AI
   vendors to prove their algorithms used to make hiring decisions are

   carrying out algorithmic risk assessments to align with the possible
   final text of the AI Act to ensure that people’s fundamental rights are
   protected.

   When relying on staffing databases to develop AI algorithms, key to
   best matching candidates with jobs, major staffing companies already
   operate under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules
   and expect those same conditions to transfer to the use of AI. Beyond
   data protection, WEC members are looking forward to receiving formal

   The introduction of AI in our lives is no longer a question of if and
   when, but of how best it can be utilized. With the ethical development
   of AI use within the HR services industry, the global and European
   labour and skills shortage can be finally addressed. Through the use of
   AI our industry will be better adept at identifying and matching the
   skills required for today, while improving the kinds of training

   In order for AI to become part of the answer to filling today’s labour

   services, AI can make a significant contribution to increasing
   diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout Europe and around the world
   and we hope the EU AI Act will help make that a reality.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence

--

   Artificial Intelligence is one of the emerging technologies which tries
   to simulate human reasoning in AI systems. John McCarthy invented the
   term Artificial Intelligence in the year 1950.

--

   Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer program to learn
   and think. Everything can be considered Artificial intelligence if it
   involves a program doing something that we would normally think would
--

   The advantages of Artificial intelligence applications are enormous and
   can revolutionize any professional sector. Let’s see some of them
--
   time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they
   are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions
   are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain
--

   Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority
   of human error.
--

   This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial intelligence. We
   can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot
   which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars,
--
   Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
   explosion in Ukraine? At that time there were no AI-powered robots that
   can help us to minimize the effect of radiation by controlling the fire

   AI Robots can be used in such situations where intervention can be
   hazardous.
--
   weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life. But
   using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they
   don’t even get bored, unlike humans.
--
   Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many
   queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.

--
   like sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors
   and many more things. Using artificial intelligence we can productively
   automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for
--
   Example: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents to get
   a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the bank. Using AI
   Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the process of verifying
--
   Example: We all know that organizations have a customer support team
   that needs to clarify the doubts and queries of the customers. Using AI
   the organizations can set up a Voice bot or Chatbot which can help
--

   Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take
   decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While
   taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and
   practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and
   delivers the results in a faster way.
--
   Example: We all have played Chess games in Windows. It is nearly
   impossible to beat CPU in the hard mode because of the AI behind that
   game. It will take the best possible step in a very short time
--

   AI is powering many inventions in almost every domain which will help
   humans solve the majority of complex problems.
--
   Example: Recently doctors can predict breast cancer in the woman at
   earlier stages using advanced AI-based technologies.

--

   As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get
   updated with time to meet the latest requirements. Machines need
--

   AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority
   of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can
--

   As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works
   with robots,human interference is becoming less which will cause a
   major problem in the employment standards. Every organization is
   looking to replace the minimum qualified individuals with AI robots
   which can do similar work with more efficiency.
--

   These are some advantages and disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence.
   Every new invention or breakthrough will have both, but we as humans
   need to take care of that and use the positive sides of the invention
   to create a better world. Artificial intelligence has massive potential
   advantages. The key for humans will ensure the “rise of the robots”
--
   intelligence can destroy human civilization if it goes into the wrong
   hands. But still, none of the AI applications made at that scale that
   can destroy or enslave humanity.
